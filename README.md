# Multi-Modal AI for Fraud Detection in Digital Transactions

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **multi-modal and hybrid fraud detection system** that integrates **structured transaction data, unstructured text logs, image-based fraud detection, and graph-based fraud analysis**. The goal is to build a **scalable, modular, and open-source** fraud detection pipeline that can detect fraudulent transactions using multiple AI models.

## 🚀 Features

- **Structured Data Fraud Detection** (XGBoost, Random Forest) for anomaly detection in transaction logs.
- **Text-Based Fraud Analysis** (BERT/GPT) for detecting fraud in emails, transaction descriptions, and customer messages.
- **Image-Based Forgery Detection** (CNNs) for identifying tampered documents, checks, and ID fraud.
- **Graph-Based Fraud Ring Analysis** (GNNs, Neo4j) for uncovering collusion and interconnected fraudulent accounts.
- **Ensemble Model** to combine predictions from multiple modalities into a final fraud score.

## 🎯 Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Data Preprocessing & Baseline Model (XGBoost for transactions)
2. **Phase 2**: Implement Multi-Modal Models (NLP for text, CNN for images)
3. **Phase 3**: Graph-Based Fraud Detection (GNNs, Neo4j integration)
4. **Phase 4**: Ensemble & Model Fusion (Combining multiple predictions)
5. **Phase 5**: Deployment & API Integration (Future - Cloud Setup for free-tier testing)
